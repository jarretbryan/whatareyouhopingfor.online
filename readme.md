# What Are You Hoping For? (v1)

_What Are You Hoping For?_ is a project made to help me work through my interactions in social media.

### Background 
A lot of social media (Twitter, IG, FB) essentially takes in information via a form, stores it on the backend to use the data, and just displays the submitted information back to the user, and the user's 'network'. 

I'm grappling with 2 major and disparate ideas. 
Firstly, here data is not stored on any backend - all logic is client-side, lost on refresh. I also wanted the user to have something different at the end of the process - rather than only have the information displayed to a network, the user at the end of the process gets something physical - a receipt - to act as proof that they were online. The receipt is meant to be the only proof since no data is stored.

This `reciept as proof` links to the second idea - why do we go on social media? *What are we hoping for?* I think this has been interogated a great deal, but what I'm focused on here is absent the _social_ aspect, can validation exist online? Do we need to prove to another that we WERE online? Could a receipt function as that proof?



### Construction

_What Are You Hoping For_ was made under the care and support of [fruitful.school](https://fruitful.school/) during the Fall 2020 workshop.

This is still a work in progress. This first iteration was handcoded. For some reason, I was comitted to not using any libraries or frameworks. 

It was good return to using vanilla JS, which I haven't used for a bit. I had fun playing around and making a mess with the script. 

Am I happy with the CSS? Hahaha.

I wanted to make it a bit more programatically complex - have a dynamic response based on user input, allow the user to answer multiple choice questions, upload images. That will have to wait. I may opt to use libraries in the future.

### Other Cool Things

An earlier technical proof of concept in generating another file based on user input can be found here: https://glitch.com/~html-generator-poc - it was originally meant to be part of a Zine Generator.

This was not a direct inspiration since I was unaware of it when I started, but a work that was pointed out to me in the midst of building this: Rhea Dillon's _Uchronia et Uchromia_. [External Pages](https://externalpages.org/#rhea-dillon) & [Uchronia et Uchromia](https://externalpages.org/rhea-dillon) This also takes the form of a long questionaire, that at the end generates a poster of asemic art based on user input. 

As described: 
>Uchronia et Uchromia is a new interactive artwork by Rhea Dillon. By taking the form of an online questionnaire, the net artwork highlights the process of being questioned in the context of the Black experience today.

>...

>Questionnaires are a tool used by many institutions across society such as entrance exams in education, which operate as gatekeeping mechanisms. By adopting this framework, ideas of power, control and inequality come to the fore. Referencing how her own experiences shaped the artwork, Dillon emphases that the endless supply of questions that demand existential and fugitive thinking represents “the interrogation of a Black person in our society: there are hardly ever any answers, or information.” 

It's fantastic and I strongly recommend spending time with it if you can.
